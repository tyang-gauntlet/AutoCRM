# AutoCRM

Develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to manage customer data, track interactions, and improve customer engagement. The solution will leverage modern web technologies for a lightweight, scalable, and user-friendly application. The application will be built with a focus on API first design and real-time data updates for automation and AI. The goal is to lay groundwork to enable a highly automated customer service system, where AI resolves most tickets and significantly reduces the workload on human agents.
