# AutoCRM

Develop a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to manage customer data, track interactions, and improve customer engagement. The solution will leverage modern web technologies for a lightweight, scalable, and user-friendly application. The application will be built with a focus on API first design and real-time data updates for automation and AI. The goal is to lay groundwork to enable a highly automated customer service system, where AI resolves most tickets and significantly reduces the workload on human agents.

## Technologies

- NextJS 14 / React 18
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase 
- Shadcn (NOT SHADCN UI) / Radix UI
- Lucid Icons
- AWS Amplify
- OpenAI API / Anthropic API (for LLM integration)
- pgvector (for Supabase vector embeddings)
- Vercel AI SDK
- LangChain / LlamaIndex (for RAG implementation)

Ensure you use the latest version of each technology.
